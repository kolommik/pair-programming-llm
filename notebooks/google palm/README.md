# Obtaining an API Key from Generative AI by Google

## Introduction
This document describes the process of obtaining an API key for working with Generative AI by Google. It also provides a solution for users located outside the United States to access this API.

## Steps to Get the API Key

1. **Visit the website**: Navigate to [developers.generativeai.google/products/palm](https://developers.generativeai.google/products/palm) to obtain your API key.

### Important Note
- **U.S. IP Address Required**: Access to this site must be from a U.S. IP address. If you are located outside the U.S., you may need to use a VPN service.

## Setting Up Routing Through a VPN

After you've obtained your API key, the next step is to set up routing your traffic through a U.S. IP address.

1. **Find the IP Addresses for Routing**: Open the command prompt and execute the following commands:
    ```cmd
    nslookup generativelanguage.googleapis.com
    ping generativelanguage.googleapis.com
    ```
    These commands will help identify the IP addresses that your traffic will go through.

2. **Configure Routing**: Set up your system so that all the traffic directed to these IP addresses goes through your VPN. This is usually done through routing commands in your operating system.

3. **Check the Routing**: After setting up the routing, execute the following command:
    ```cmd
    tracert generativelanguage.googleapis.com
    ```
    The result of this command should display the IP address of your VPN.

## Conclusion
By following these instructions, you'll be able to not only obtain an API key for Generative AI by Google but also configure your system for proper operation with this API.
